Steps:

I started with a model similar to the model in the course provided sample code src5/digits/handwriting.py. I modified the input_shape of the convolution layer to match (IMG_WIDTH, IMG_HEIGHT, 3). I also modified the output layer to have NUM_CATEGORIES number of nodes. Using this model, the image was accurately identified only <10% of the time. To improve this I began by increasing the number of filters on the convolution layer. This had a small impact on accuracy, but also increased the running time. A value of 64 for the number of filters and a size of 3*3 for the convolution filter seemed to be the best balance of speed and accuracy. I also tried adding pooling layers and changing their sizes. Pooling layers of larger sizes sped up the process, but reduced the accuracy. Due to this I stuck with a pooling size of 2*2 and just one pooling layer.
At this time the accuracy of the neural network was <30% so I began experimenting with hidden layers. Adding a single hidden layer improved accuracy proportional to the number of units in the layer. However, large numbers of units in this layer significantly slowed running time. Choosing a number sqrt(NUM_CATEGORIES * NUMBER_INPUT_FILTERS) seemed to maximize accuracy while keeping running time low. Adding additional hidden layers also had an impact on accuracy as well as running time. By adding 3 hidden layers, each having 1/2 the units of the previous, allowed accuracy >90% to be achieved as well as maintaining acceptable run time. A dropout ratio of 0.2 on the convolutional layer to prevent over reliance on any one unit proved beneficial to overall accuracy, however dropout on the hidden layers had limited effect.
